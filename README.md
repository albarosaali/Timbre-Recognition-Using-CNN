# Timbre Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks

This project aims to distinguish instruments in a mix by their timbre (and recognise their pitch) by using convolutional neural networks (CNN). Here code required to generate and label MIDI data, and to train and test a convolutional neural network is provided (along with the data used for testing).
